			<br/>
			The Mars Science Laboratory is also known as the Curiosity rover.  It is a car-sized robotic rover that is exploring Mars.  It landed on Mars on August 6, 2012.  
			<br/>
			<br/>
			The goals of the Curiosity Rover include:
		</p>
		<h5>Biological objectives:</h5>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Determine the nature and inventory of organic carbon compounds
			</li>
			<li>
				Inventory the chemical building blocks of life (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, and sulfur)
			</li>
			<li>
				Identify features that may represent the effects of biological processes
			</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h5>Geological and geochemical objectives:</h5>
		<ol>	
			<li>
				Investigate the chemical, isotopic, and mineralogical composition of the martian surface and near-surface geological materials
			</li>
			<li>
				Interpret the processes that have formed and modified rocks and soils
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h5>Planetary process objectives:</h5>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Assess long-timescale (i.e., 4-billion-year) atmospheric evolution processes
			</li>
			<li>
				Determine present state, distribution, and cycling of water and carbon dioxide
			</li>
		</ol>	
		<h5>Surface radiation objective:</h5>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Characterize the broad spectrum of surface radition, including galactic cosmic radiation, solar proton events, and secondary neutrons
			</li>
		</ol>

			To accomplish these goals the rover carries the biggest, most advanced suite of instruments for scientific studies ever sent to the Martian planet.  
		<br/>
			It has state of the art cameras, spectrometers, radiation detection, environmental sensors, and atmospheric sensors (to learn more about the scientific method <br/>click <a href = "scientificmethod.html">HERE</a>).

		<br/>
			The Curiosity rover will analyze samples scooped from the soil and drilled from rocks.  The roverâ€™s onboard laboratory will study rocks, soils, and the local geologic <br/>setting in order to detect the necessary chemical building blocks of life.  It will also try to assess what the Martian environment was like in the past.  It will pass all the <br/>information it gathers through the NASA Deep Space Network.  The DSN is an international network of antennas that provide the communication links between the <br/>scientists and the engineers on Earth to the missions in space and on Mars.  Right now it is preparing to drill into the first Martian rocks since in landed.  This is the <br/>most challenging activity since the landing because of how complex all of the instruments are in gathering the particles left over from the drilling and putting samples <br/>of it into the sensors as it tries to determine if there were signs of water or even microbial life.
