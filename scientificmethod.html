		<h1>The Scientific Method</h1>
		<hr/>
		<p>
			The Scientific Method is a set of steps that you ask to get answers to a scientific question that you may have through observations <br/>and experiments.  All observations and experiments need to be able to be replicated and be fair.  A fair test occurs when you change <br/>only one variable and keep all of the other conditions the same.  The scientific method is used by scientists to find a cause and effect <br/>relationships in nature.  Scientists design an experiment so that changes to one item can cause a reaction that is predictable.  The <br/>scientific method consists of 7 steps.

				Analyze your data and draw a conclusion

			At any time during the process of coming to a conclusion you may have to go back a few steps when new data comes in.  After you <br/>analyze your data you need to see if your original hypothesis fits with the data.  If it doesnâ€™t then you will need to create a new <br/>hypothesis and test it out with more experiments.  This refinement of your hypothesis helps narrow down what the data is saying and <br/>what the final conclusion is.  A process like the scientific method that involves such backup up and repeating is called an iterative <br/>process.  Keeping a good record of your ideas and information is essential to communicating your results.
