        <p>I have been a colts fan since I was 4.  I picked the colts because at the time I didn't
            have a favorite team.  So on my blanket with all the NFL logos I closed my eyes and 
            picked one.  I have been a colts fan ever since.  <h2>This is crazy stuff</h2><br>

            Today's HTML lesson:
            <br>
            To place a &lt; &gt; in your page, write &amp;lt; in the HTML.
            <br>
